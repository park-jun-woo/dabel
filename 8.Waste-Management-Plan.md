# Waste Management Plan

The DABEL project’s waste management plan is dedicated to maintaining a sustainable, zero-waste architecture in space. This chapter focuses exclusively on space-based waste generated by the project, including orbital debris from launches and spacecraft, manufacturing and construction waste at the Earth–L4 (EL4) site, and slag or mining byproducts from processing asteroid 16 Psyche’s ore. The plan incorporates international best practices — notably NASA’s Orbital Debris Mitigation Guidelines and the United Nations COPUOS recommendations — to ensure safety and sustainability. Quantitative projections are provided for each mission phase, outlining expected waste tonnage and recycling or reuse rates over time. By proactively managing waste, DABEL demonstrates a commitment to long-term orbital sustainability and alignment with global standards.

## Orbital Debris Mitigation for Launches and Spacecraft

The dense cloud around Earth represents debris in low Earth orbit, while the outer band corresponds to objects in geosynchronous orbit. This environment underlines the importance of strict orbital debris mitigation measures.*

All mission launches and spacecraft operations will adhere to strict orbital debris mitigation practices to avoid contributing to the debris population. DABEL’s launch vehicles are designed for minimal debris release: no components are intentionally jettisoned in persistent orbit during normal operations, in line with UN guidelines recommending that space systems **“be designed not to release debris during normal operations.”** For example, if any sensor covers or fairings must be released, they will be disposed of in trajectories that ensure prompt atmospheric re-entry or retrieval. Whenever feasible, reusable launch stages and spacecraft will be employed so that spent stages do not remain in orbit as debris. Any non-reusable upper stages will carry sufficient propellant to deorbit themselves or move to a safe disposal orbit after deployment, complying with the 25-year rule for de-orbit in low Earth orbit (as recommended by international debris mitigation standards).

To prevent accidental breakups, all spacecraft and orbital stages will undergo “passivation” at end-of-life — meaning residual fuels, batteries, and high-pressure fluids will be safely vented or de-energized. This follows the COPUOS Space Debris Mitigation Guideline that spacecraft should be designed to **“avoid failure modes which may lead to accidental break-ups,”** and that stored energy should be removed at mission end to prevent explosions. In practice, DABEL vehicles will include features to dump propellants and disconnect power sources once their mission is complete. Collision avoidance protocols will also be observed throughout operations, scheduling maneuvers if necessary to avoid known debris or other active satellites.

**Compliance with International Standards:** The Waste Management Plan fully implements the NASA Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices and the UN COPUOS guidelines. NASA’s standard practices aim to limit the generation of new, long-lived debris by controlling debris release, minimizing debris from explosions, adopting safe flight profiles to prevent collisions, and executing post-mission disposal. In fact, NASA requires all missions to include orbital debris assessments and end-of-mission disposal plans as part of project development. DABEL follows this model by integrating debris mitigation into every mission phase. Our orbital hardware will be removed from useful orbits after operations: for low Earth orbits, components will deorbit within the 25-year guideline (often much sooner), and for geosynchronous transfer or higher orbits, any spent stages will be relocated to designated graveyard orbits or heliocentric disposal orbits. Adhering to these practices ensures that **no derelict DABEL objects are left drifting in populated orbits** beyond their service life.

Quantitatively, the goal is near-zero *net* debris creation. During the **Launch and Deployment Phase**, each mission is engineered so that at most a few tens of kilograms of material (if any) remain in orbit as debris, and any such material is short-lived (deorbiting or solar-orbiting within years). **Over 95% of launch mass** will either reach the destination or be deliberately disposed of as per plan. As the project progresses, improved designs aim to achieve **>99% post-mission disposal compliance**. By the operational phase, DABEL intends to be effectively *debris-neutral*, meaning any new objects we put into orbit are balanced by removal or safe disposal of an equivalent mass of material. This approach aligns with emerging industry goals – for instance, the European Space Agency intends to achieve “zero net debris” addition by 2030 – and DABEL will match or exceed these benchmarks from the outset. Through rigorous implementation of guidelines and innovative debris prevention (like in-orbit refueling and servicing to extend spacecraft lifetimes), the project will minimize its orbital footprint and preserve the space environment for future generations.

## Manufacturing and Construction Waste at EL4

The Earth–L4 point will serve as DABEL’s primary construction and manufacturing site, where habitats and infrastructure (such as O’Neill cylinders, solar collector arrays, and other large structures) are assembled. In keeping with a **zero-waste philosophy**, the project will carefully manage any waste generated during fabrication and assembly processes at EL4. This includes metal shavings, scraps from machining or 3D printing, rejected or defective components, and any packaging or ancillary materials from shipped parts. Rather than treating these byproducts as expendable waste, DABEL will treat them as valuable in-orbit resources to be recycled or repurposed.

Several strategies will ensure minimal waste during construction:

* **High-efficiency Manufacturing:** Wherever possible, additive manufacturing (3D printing) and near-net-shape casting techniques will be used to produce parts, which dramatically reduce scrap compared to traditional subtractive machining. For instance, 3D printing of habitat structural components can utilize close to 100% of the feedstock material, leaving negligible off-cuts or shavings. If milling or cutting is needed, the machinery will be designed to capture cuttings and dust in a closed system (preventing their release into space) and funnel them for recycling.

* **In-Orbit Recycling Facilities:** An on-site “scrap refining unit” at EL4 will melt down and reprocess metal scraps or discarded parts into raw material for new construction. Aluminium, steel, titanium, and other metals present in any waste will be segregated and fed back into the manufacturing supply chain. According to recent studies, recycling space hardware is technically feasible; in fact, recycling existing orbital materials (especially high-value metals like aluminum) is seen as a “low-hanging fruit” for sustainable space operations. DABEL’s plan leverages this by ensuring virtually all metallic waste is remanufactured. For example, if a support truss is built and a 5% mass fraction is trimmed off as scrap, that 5% will be collected and re-smelted to make new components rather than discarded.

* **Modular Construction and Reuse:** The project emphasizes modular design, so that if a structure or vehicle becomes obsolete, its components can be refurbished or re-used in new assemblies. Large structural elements at EL4 (girders, panels, shells) will be built with standardized interfaces, making it easier to repurpose them or replace sub-units without scrapping the whole. This approach is in line with evolving in-orbit servicing and circular economy practices (e.g. replaceable module components and life-extension servicing), which aim to **“refurbish, repurpose and reuse”** hardware by 2050. DABEL will implement these practices from the beginning to avoid creating waste from retired components.

The waste management plan projects that during the **Construction/Assembly Phase**, the **recycling rate will exceed 90%** of manufacturing waste by mass, and it will improve over time. In early operations, if (hypothetically) 100 metric tons of raw material are processed at EL4, at most \~5–10 tons might end up as off-cuts or errors; of that, over 9 tons would be directly recycled. By later phases, advanced techniques aim for **99% reuse of all industrial scrap**, effectively creating a closed-loop manufacturing ecosystem. Any materials that cannot be immediately recycled (for example, certain composites or polymer materials used in insulation) will be safely stored for future processing or used in secondary applications (such as filler material). The end goal is that **no construction residue is dumped into space or left unused**. Every bolt, shaving, or broken tool is accounted for: it will either be repaired, melted down for raw material, or utilized as shielding mass or ballast.

In terms of absolute quantities, the **Manufacturing Waste** at EL4 is expected to be modest relative to the throughput. During habitat module fabrication, the plan anticipates on the order of **several thousand tons of material** will be processed in total. Thanks to high-efficiency methods, waste should be limited to a few hundred tons at most over the whole construction timeline, nearly all of which will be reintegrated into the project. By continuously monitoring material flows, the team will quantify waste generation and steadily drive those numbers down. Yearly sustainability audits will be performed to verify how much material was wasted vs. recycled, ensuring the project meets its targets for waste reduction. This aggressive recycling approach echoes ESA’s vision of a space circular economy, where long-term orbital sustainability is achieved by treating even “waste” hardware as a resource to avoid new extractions. DABEL’s construction at EL4 will thus set a benchmark for in-space industrial ecology, proving that large-scale building can occur without leaving behind trash or debris.

## Mining and Processing Waste from 16 Psyche Ore

One of the unique aspects of DABEL is the extraction of raw materials from asteroid **16 Psyche**, a metal-rich asteroid in the main belt, to supply the EL4 construction. Effective waste management in this context means handling two categories of material: **mining waste (rock or low-grade ore excavated from Psyche)**, and **processing waste (slag)** generated when refining the ore into metals. The plan deliberately separates mining and smelting locations to maximize energy efficiency and material reuse. Notably, **ore from 16 Psyche will not be smelted in the asteroid belt**; instead, bulk ore will be transported to EL4 for refining. This decision is driven by both energy considerations and sustainability goals.

&#x20;*Illustration of asteroid 16 Psyche, a metal-rich “M-type” asteroid about 220 km in diameter. Psyche’s composition is thought to be a mixture of rock and metallic iron-nickel. Extracting its metals will yield a significant amount of rocky waste (slag), which DABEL plans to repurpose as radiation shielding and construction material in orbit.*

**Justification for Earth–L4 Smelting:** 16 Psyche orbits the Sun at roughly 2.5 to 3.3 astronomical units from the Sun (approximately 378–497 million km), which is about three times farther out than Earth. At that distance, sunlight is only about 10–15% as intense as near Earth, severely limiting the availability of solar energy for power. Mining and especially metallurgical smelting are energy-intensive processes, requiring either abundant electricity or concentrated heat. Conducting these processes at Psyche would be extremely challenging with solar power alone due to the weak sunlight. (For comparison, Earth-orbit solar panels receive \~1360 W/m², whereas at Psyche the flux is only \~150 W/m² or less.) While nuclear reactors or other power sources could be used in the belt, they would add complexity and mass to the mining operations. Instead, DABEL will **transport raw ore to EL4**, where solar energy is plentiful and continuous. At Earth’s Lagrange 4 (1 AU from the Sun), large solar arrays or mirrors can supply the gigawatts of power needed to run smelters and electrolysis furnaces. This approach follows expert analyses which note that mining asteroids is only worthwhile if an adequate local energy source is available; otherwise the cost of supplying energy to distant asteroids negates the benefits. By bringing the ore to EL4, we place the refining process in an energy-rich environment (nearly constant sunlight at L4) while also situating it next to our construction site, simplifying logistics.

**Mining Waste Management at Psyche:** Mining operations on Psyche will involve extracting material from the asteroid’s surface or subsurface, likely by robotic excavators. Given Psyche’s estimated composition — **roughly 30%–60% metal by volume and the remainder silicate rock** — a significant portion of the excavated material will be non-metallic rock or low-metal ore. Rather than indiscriminately grinding up the asteroid, the plan is to perform **beneficiation** at the asteroid: basically concentrating the high-metal-content material and separating out some of the useless rocky debris. Any initial separation will be done in a controlled manner to prevent creating free-floating debris. For example, miners might crush ore and use magnetic or density separation to pull out metal-rich fragments. The leftover rocky gravel (mining tailings) can be deposited back onto Psyche’s surface in designated containment areas (like a crater or trench) so that it remains largely secure on the asteroid and does not become orbital debris. The **bulk mining waste** (excess rock) will thus mostly remain on Psyche, where it poses no hazard to space navigation. To be cautious, any dust generated will be captured by enclosures or electrostatic collection methods to avoid it escaping Psyche’s weak gravity.

Only the concentrated ore (with a high fraction of metal) will be sent on the transfer journey to EL4. This ensures we are not wasting propellant hauling unneeded rock. It is projected that in early mining campaigns, perhaps only **20-30%** of mined mass will be sent to EL4 as ore, with the rest being inert rubble left behind neatly on Psyche. As technology improves, in-situ separation could allow an even smaller fraction (just the metal) to be transported. However, DABEL also plans for eventual utilization of **all** parts of the asteroid: the rock tailings left on Psyche could later be used in-situ for other purposes (like construction of facilities on the asteroid or as reaction mass for propulsion) in future missions, so even that “waste” is viewed as a potential resource.

**Refining and Slag Reuse at EL4:** Once the ore arrives at EL4, it will be processed in orbital smelting facilities powered by solar energy. The smelting of Psyche’s ore (rich in iron, nickel, and other metals) will produce **metal outputs** for manufacturing and a byproduct of **slag** – the non-metallic residue composed of silicate rock, oxides, and other impurities separated from the metal. Instead of discarding this slag, DABEL will fully integrate it into our construction plans. Slag and other industrial byproducts are earmarked for secondary use as radiation shielding and structural fill, particularly in the walls of O’Neill cylinders and other large habitats.

Using slag as a construction material is both practical and beneficial. The slag from metal smelting is essentially rock or ceramic-like material. In a habitat, mass is an asset for radiation protection: a thick layer of rock or slag around living areas can significantly attenuate cosmic rays and solar radiation. **NASA’s own research into in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) has identified slag as valuable for habitat shielding**. By packing slag into the outer hulls of stations or forming it into bricks, we turn a waste product into life-saving infrastructure. For example, one proposal for space settlement noted that the slag from asteroid iron smelting could be used to shield a large habitat with thousands of residents. In our plan, every ton of slag produced at EL4 will be cast into useful forms: slabs, bricks, or loose fill that can be layered onto habitats. The bulk mining waste (rocky material) can similarly be processed (e.g. sintered into rock blocks) and used as filler mass in non-pressurized parts of structures, or as shielding berms around sensitive equipment.

Quantitatively, we anticipate **high volumes of slag** corresponding to the volume of metal extracted. If, for instance, **one million tons** of ore are processed and (hypothetically) yield \~500,000 tons of metal, there will be on the order of **500,000 tons of slag** produced (exact ratios depend on ore grade). This slag will not be dumped into space or treated as refuse; instead, that half-million tons would be immediately earmarked for construction uses. For perspective, half a million tons of slag could provide a **5-meter thick shielding layer** for an enormous cylindrical habitat on the order of kilometers in size, dramatically improving its habitability by reducing radiation to safe levels. In the long term, as more of Psyche’s material is processed (potentially tens of millions of tons over decades), the accumulated slag and rock will enable the expansion of permanent facilities – essentially **turning Psyche’s remnants into the building blocks of a cislunar city**.

During the **Transport and Refining Phase**, we project a **slag reuse rate of effectively 100%**. Every kilogram of slag or mineral waste will be allocated a purpose. If there is ever a surplus beyond immediate construction needs, it will be stored in stable configurations (for example, kept in container modules at EL4 or formed into solid blocks) for future use rather than discarded. By the mature phase of DABEL operations, the concept of “waste” slag will essentially disappear – it becomes a commodity. In summary, **ore refining at EL4 will be a closed-loop industrial process**: raw asteroid material goes in, useful metal and useful slag come out, and nothing is simply thrown away.

## Quantitative Waste Projections by Mission Phase

To tie the above elements together, the following outlines each major mission phase with estimated waste generation and reuse metrics:

1. **Launch & Deployment Phase:** In this initial phase, waste comes primarily from launch vehicle stages and any deployment mechanisms. Thanks to reusable launch systems and debris mitigation, *discarded mass* is kept minimal. **Estimated orbital debris:** <0.1% of total launched mass. For example, a 100-ton payload launch might leave at most \~100 kg in orbit (and even that would be planned for rapid re-entry). **Recycling/Reuse:** Not applicable during launch, but any jettisoned hardware is either recovered (reusable boosters) or destroyed in atmosphere. By the end of this phase, all launch debris will have been accounted for (no long-lived junk left in space). The project aims for **100% of launch stages either reused or deorbited** within 25 years of launch.

2. **Construction & Manufacturing Phase (EL4):** This phase sees assembly of stations and infrastructure at the EL4 point. **Estimated waste:** For an anticipated throughput of \~10,000 tons of material in early construction, about 500 tons might be scrap or off-cuts (5%). With improved processes, later builds might reduce scrap to <1%. **Recycling/Reuse:** Initially 90–95% of manufacturing waste is recycled, climbing to \~99% as in-orbit recycling tech matures. For instance, out of 500 tons of early scrap, \~475 tons are reprocessed into useful material and 25 tons might be temporarily stored for recycling improvements. No scrap is abandoned; even temporary excess will be stockpiled safely at EL4 for future use. We expect **near-zero permanent waste** from construction – effectively all metal and material stays in the productive loop.

3. **Asteroid Mining Phase (Extraction at 16 Psyche):** During active mining, waste consists of non-valuable rock excavated. **Estimated waste:** In one mining campaign, if 1 million tons of asteroid material are mined, perhaps 700,000–800,000 tons could be leftover rock after concentrating 200,000–300,000 tons of ore. **Handling:** 100% of this bulk waste rock is contained on Psyche itself (in piles or storage areas). None of it is allowed to float off as debris. It remains available for future utilization (i.e., not truly wasted). So although a large mass of material is dug up, it doesn’t litter space – it’s quarantined on the asteroid’s surface. **Recycling:** Not immediate, but planned future use (e.g., building shielding on Psyche or processing at a later date). For the purposes of current mission accounting, we can say \~0% of mining waste is *immediately* recycled, but 100% is *safely stored* for potential future use, with zero left as uncontrolled debris.

4. **Transport & Refining Phase (Ore to EL4 and Smelting):** As ore is shipped and refined, waste appears as slag. **Estimated waste:** If 200,000 tons of ore are refined in a given batch and 50% is metal, roughly 100,000 tons of slag result. **Recycling/Reuse:** 100% of that slag is repurposed at EL4. Immediately, it might be used to fabricate \~100,000 modular blocks for radiation shielding or mixed into concrete for structures. None of the slag is dumped. In terms of time-based projection, over, say, 5 years of refining operations, if 1 million tons of ore are processed, about 0.5 million tons metal and 0.5 million tons slag accumulate. The metal goes into building spacecraft and habitats; the half-million tons of slag goes into those habitats as shielding mass. By the end of this phase, the goal is **zero tons of unutilized slag** remaining. (Any surplus stockpiled is considered planned material for future expansion, not waste.)

5. **Operational Phase (Maintenance & Life Support):** During long-term operation of DABEL facilities, waste includes things like worn-out parts, packaging from supplies, and possibly life support byproducts. **Estimated waste:** This is relatively small compared to industrial volumes – perhaps a few tons per year of miscellaneous hardware and a continuous loop of life-support recyclables (air/water/organic waste). **Recycling/Reuse:** All metal parts from repairs are sent to the EL4 recycling unit (aiming for close to 100% reuse). Worn electronics might be cannibalized for components. Any plastic or composite waste is an area of ongoing research; we plan to use compactors or possibly pyrolysis to break down and reuse these materials as well. Human waste and biological waste will be processed by environmental control systems into fertilizer or base nutrients for closed-loop life support, following the ISS’s example of recycling 80–90% of water and waste. Our target is to reach **>95% closure** on the life-support loop (minimal venting or dumping) and to **reuse essentially all solid hardware**, achieving near-total recycling during operations. If a large item truly cannot be recycled, it will be safely stowed until it can be returned to Earth or used as filler mass, rather than jettisoned.

6. **Decommissioning Phase (End-of-Life):** Although DABEL is envisioned as a long-term installation, eventually equipment or structures may be retired. The waste plan for decommissioning is to **avoid creating derelict structures**. Large habitats or facilities at EL4 that reach end-of-life will either be repurposed for other uses, broken down into modules for recycling, or, if necessary, moved to a disposal orbit (for example, sending it into a heliocentric orbit away from Earth’s vicinity). **Estimated waste:** Ideally zero new waste – every structure is harvested. If an O’Neill cylinder in orbit centuries from now were to be abandoned, we would treat its materials as an asset: either maintaining it for a new population or mining it for raw materials. In compliance with the UN long-term sustainability guidelines, no intact DABEL facility will be left uncontrolled in an orbit where it could pose a hazard; all end-of-life hardware will be accounted for and handled responsibly.

Across all phases, these quantitative targets underscore a philosophy: **everything we launch or mine is accounted for in the system**. Whether as functional product or as reusable waste, it all serves a purpose and is prevented from harming the space environment. By designing the mission from the ground up with closed-loop material flows in mind, DABEL commits to far exceeding the minimum requirements of space debris mitigation.

## Commitment to Long-Term Sustainability and Zero-Waste Architecture

In conclusion, the DABEL project’s waste management plan is an integral part of its design for a sustainable space presence. It combines **international best practices** (NASA and COPUOS debris mitigation rules) with innovative **in-space recycling and reuse strategies** to ensure that our activities do not pollute the orbital environment. All space-based waste streams — orbital debris, construction scrap, and mining slag — are meticulously managed so that virtually nothing is simply discarded. This approach mirrors and extends global efforts like ESA’s goal of orbital debris neutrality and a space circular economy. DABEL will demonstrate that large-scale space development (mining asteroids, building habitats) can be done in harmony with safety and sustainability.

The plan is not just about complying with rules; it’s about setting a new **standard of “zero-waste” in orbit**. By reusing slag as shielding, recycling spent spacecraft into feedstock, and eliminating persistent debris, DABEL ensures that each mission phase contributes to a regenerative cycle. Our O’Neill cylinders and EL4 facilities will quite literally be built out of what others might consider waste – turning potential liabilities into assets. This not only protects the environment but also reduces the need to haul materials from Earth, making the project more efficient and self-sufficient over time.

Finally, ongoing review and improvement are built into the waste management plan. The project will continuously monitor its waste outputs and update practices as new technologies (e.g. advanced in-orbit recycling methods or debris removal techniques) become available. **Transparency** will be maintained by publishing waste and recycling metrics, showing the world that DABEL remains true to its sustainable mandate. In doing so, the project intends to inspire and inform future space ventures, proving that humanity’s expansion into space can follow a path of *responsible stewardship*. With this Waste Management Plan, DABEL takes a decisive step toward a future where space industry and environmental care go hand in hand, ensuring that near-Earth space and the asteroid belt are kept pristine even as we utilize their resources for the benefit of all.
